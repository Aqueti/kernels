Document: Compiling the Kernel and the DTB for IMX 274 with the Leopard Imaging Board for Tegra-TX2 with Jetpack 3.1.

Note: This document assumes you have a Jetpack-3.1 installed for Tegra-TX2 on your 64 bit Ubuntu OS Machine.

1.Create a work folder under /home on your host 64 bit Ubuntu Machine:
  $ sudo mkdir /home/work
  $ sudo chown -R <user_name> /home/work

2. Under /usr/src/kernel/kernel-4.4 folder, run:
  $ make -j4 O=$TEGRA_KERNEL_OUT tegra18_defconfig
  $ make -j4 O=$TEGRA_KERNEL_OUT zImage
  $ make -j4 O=$TEGRA_KERNEL_OUT dtbs

 -After this, you will get Image and zImage under /home/work/TX2/kernel/kernel_out/arch/arm64/boot 
  and tegra186-quill-p3310-1000-c03-00-base.dtb under /home/work/TX2/kernel/kernel_out/arch/arm64/boot/dts.

3. Copy the Image and zImage from /home/work/TX2/kernel/kernel_out/arch/arm64/boot of your host 64 bit Ubuntu OS Machine to /boot folder of your NVIDIA tegra.
 -Alternately, you may skip steps 1 and 2 and directly use the ready images from the images folders provided herewith.

4. Copy and replace the tegra186-quill-p3310-1000-c03-00-base.dtb from /home/work/TX2/kernel/kernel_out/arch/arm64/boot/dts to Linux_for_Tegra/kernel/dtb on your host PC.
 -Alternately, you may skip steps 1 and 2 and directly use the said dtb from the images folders provided herewith.

5. Under Linux_for_Tegra/ on your host machine, run the following command to flash the device tree blob onto your Tegra:
  $ sudo ./flash.sh -r -k kernel-dtb jetson-tx2 mmcblk0p1

6. Reboot the TX2.

7. Open a terminal and and run the following command to get live video output:
  $ nvgstcapture-1.0
